i'm feeling low since all my team mates are gone into different project and i am left alone without any projects.
I'm i bench now.I'm getting 2 call everyday.But i'm not able to crack interview since i'm not well prepared.
I have brought clothes for gym today but i don't think i will go.
I'm in confusion whether to stay in chennai and work in any project i get and try for other companies in bangalore or i should get bangalore project within cognizant.
I'm not confident that i can crack interview outside cognizant.
I want to spend rest of my life with my mom.
I want to travel whole world.
